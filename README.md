# SRCNet-SemanticModel

## Description
This repository contains the semantic model of the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet). It is organized into three main folders:

- **Model/**
  Hosts JSON files (SRCNet_model and SRCNet_model_TestData)

- **Competency_Questions/**
  Includes SPARQL queries and their respective outputs

- **Diagrams/**
  Visual representations of the model and its components.

This structure enables to demonstrate the consistency and robustness of the semantic model for the SRCNet, providing more clarity and a better understanding of the model.

## Usage

Replicate the SRCNet_model json file, load it with your data, convert it into RDF, use the RDF file to create your dataset in Apache Jena Fuseki and make your SPARQL queries.


## Contributions

- One: Clone this repository.
